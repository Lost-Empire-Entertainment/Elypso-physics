0.1:

- only uses glm and c++ 20 standard libraries
- works on windows and linux
- simple AABB collision with cubes, has sphere collider as placeholder
- rigidbody class holds collider and several tweakable variables
- placeholder friction
- adjustable offset position, rotation and scale per rigidbody
- linear and angular velocity
- can apply force, impulse and torque per rigidbody
- gameobject handle index-generation system efficiently handles per-rigidbody interactions on physics library side, end user just needs to implement a way to handle how they want to use it on their end
- global gravity, per-rigidbody gravity toggle, dynamic state toggle and gravity factor float
- automatic sleep-wake system to efficiently handle system resources
- automatic resource cleanup if physics library goes out of scope
